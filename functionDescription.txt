Power supply:
	stage 1: external power supply, 230vac-48vdc, switched, pref low ripple - medical spec would be nice (super galvanic isolation)
	stage 2: psu for control section, 5v
	stage 3: psu for amp section: 48-45v buck/buck-boost depending on requirements

audioInBoard: Input section (ADC, amps, etc) galvanically isolated, should give good protection against lightning/ground potential differences
	Should also contain digital inputs, like SPDIF, Optical SPDIF, maybe usb
	
mainControlAndProcessingBoard: includes DSP, DAC, amps, uC, I/O for knobs and screen
	Provides low impedance output to power stage
	Modes of operation:
		BT-DSP-DAC
		AIN-DSP-DAC
		DIN-DSP-DAC
	DSP an always be set to have a 1:1 transfer function
	probably would make sense to have digital/analog signal outputs too, the device would then be able to work as an effect processor too
	maybe can be modularized, therefore modules which few would use can be sold separately as a premium]
	A/D and D/A sections should be canned and filtered to minimize noise from SMPS and other surrounding stuff

frontPanelKnobs: explains itself

AmpBoard: Amplifier board, this in principle should be the same as the harman amp, same power stage, same first stages too
